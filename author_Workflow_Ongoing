# Book Author Writing System

A professional Git-powered manuscript environment designed specifically for book authors.

---

## Purpose

This repository organizes the entire book creation process:

- drafting
- structuring
- editing
- revising
- compiling
- publishing

---

## Folder Structure

```
manuscript/
    chapters/
    front-matter/
    back-matter/

characters/
worldbuilding/
notes/
drafts/
edits/
published/
assets/
```

---

## Writing Pipeline

```
Notes → Draft → Chapter → Edit → Publish
```

---

## Folder Roles

| Folder | Function |
|------|--------|
drafts | messy writing |
chapters | real manuscript |
notes | random ideas |
edits | revision passes |
characters | character profiles |
worldbuilding | lore + rules |
published | final versions |

---

## Chapter Naming

Always number chapters:

```
01-beginning.md
02-conflict.md
03-twist.md
```

Ensures correct order when compiling book.

---

## Automated Book Builder

When pushing to main branch:

GitHub automatically:

- combines chapters
- compiles manuscript
- exports PDF

No manual formatting required.

---

## Templates Included

- chapter template
- scene template
- revision log template

Usage:

```
copy template → rename → write
```

---

## Revision System

Each edit pass goes into:

```
/edits
```

Example:

```
draft-v1.md
draft-v2.md
draft-v3.md
```

You now have a complete history of your book’s evolution.

## Professional Author Workflow

Separate mental modes:

| Mode | Folder |
|------|------|
idea brain | notes |
creative brain | drafts |
author brain | chapters |
editor brain | edits |
publisher brain | published |

---

## Writing Rule

Never edit while drafting.

Drafting = speed  
Editing = precision  

The repository enforces that separation.

---

## Philosophy

This system treats your book like software:

- versioned
- structured
- recoverable
- reproducible

---

## Result

You gain:

- full revision history
- organized manuscript
- automated publishing
- zero lost drafts
- structured creativity

---

## Recommended Tools

- VSCode
- Markdown Preview
- Git

Optional:

- Obsidian for idea capture

---

## Final Principle

You are not writing a book.

You are building a literary system.
